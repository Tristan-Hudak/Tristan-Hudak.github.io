                D&D is an old tabletop role-playing game that has many iterations. 
                The keystone that holds this game together is the players who enjoy the world the Dungeon Master creates. 
                In this process, most find themselves making a character or two. 
                This will give you the basic information on how to build a character sheet.

                On the left side we have your Ability Scores, Saving Throw Bonuses, and Skills.
                These are what determines how you interact with the world.
                The Ability Scores are broken down into six stats;
