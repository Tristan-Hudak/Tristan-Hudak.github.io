                                We did this in two ways, one by an input text reader, and another by a slider that changed the images when scrolled.
                                also we had to input a '|' between the two href's using ::before or ::after.

                                For the ball we had to use the setInterval() function.
                                For the Images we had to use for loops, 
                                I chose to use the for each loop which is technically a for loop.

                                In this project part we transfered our wireframe into html.
                                I made a few deviations to make the website more streamline.
                                I did so by consolidating parts of the About Us tab into the Notes Tab.

                                In this part of the project we were asked to add images and colors.
                                I decided to leave some place holder images because I wasnt fully sure what i should use instead as all the images i tried stretched.
                                Instead i tried to focus on the coloring.
                                Im not super set on it just yet but i feel it may grow with time.
                                On the character sheet page I still need to mange it better.

                                We were supposed to impliment a few things including an; Iframe, and two diffrent forms.
                                On the item page I added a data form where you can add an item to any of the 4 sections.
                                on the contact me form I added a form that emails me a message that is writen along with the users email.
                                on the main page i added an Iframe of a video on character building.

                                I've turned some pages into new ones. like the updated sign-in page that will lead to a sign-up page.
                                The notes page has been updated to edit and delete notes as well as show the time they were last edited.
                                The Character page has been updated to have all of its functions
